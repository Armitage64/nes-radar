# none (after tools/erase_apps.py, /flash had no main.py to back up), writes
# UIFlow's stock one-line main.py. Then sets boot_option 1 so UIFlow shows its
# launcher, and restarts. NES Radar's files stay in /flash; tools/deploy.sh
# switches back.
#
# All of this runs in one REPL session through tools/stick_repl.py. A second
# mpremote session would soft-reset into the launcher, which holds the REPL.
